Gripper Bot
This project involves the design and development of a gripper robot using Arduino and Mobitronics ESC, enabling precise control over movement and object manipulation. The robot uses PWM  the DC motors and a servo to operate the gripper mechanism, allowing for efficient object pickup and placement in various environments.

Features:

PWM-based motor control: Allows fine-tuned speed and direction adjustments for smooth movement.

Servo-controlled gripper: Provides accurate gripping and release of objects.

Autonomous and manual operation: The bot can navigate obstacles autonomously or be controlled manually.

Obstacle navigation: Optimized for navigating through obstacle-filled environments.

Technologies: Arduino, Mobitronics ESC, PWM Signals, Servo Motors, Embedded C, Robotics.
